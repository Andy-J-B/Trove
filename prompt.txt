*** Here is the context of my application :
Trove is a React Native app (built with Expo) that lets you send TikTok links to the app, 
extract products, and organize everything into categories you control. 
Itâ€™s designed to be fast, offline-friendly, and simple to use.
The backend is node, with sqlite database. Frontend is typescript react native.
When user clicks share on tiktok video to our app, it saves the url to our queue, redirects the user back to tiktok.
When user opens our app again (and for longer, not just to save to queue), then our app pops from queue and sends url to our backend server
to a transcript api, then to gemini to categorize the products. Then saves to our sqlite db.
